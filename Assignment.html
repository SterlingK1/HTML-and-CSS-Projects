			<h6> Let me tell you about one of my favorite dogs.</h6>
			<p> I love staffordshires so much! Here is a quote from thr American Kennel Club.</p>
			<blockquote cite="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/american-staffordshire-terrier/">
			The American Staffordshire Terrier, known to their fans as AmStaffs, are smart, confident, good-natured companions. 
			Their courage is proverbial. A responsibly bred, well-socialized AmStaff is a loyal, trustworthy friend to the end.
